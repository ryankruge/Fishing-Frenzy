[Fishing Frenzy]

[Description] This is a very simple text-based math game that you can play. This was a random mini-project that I decided to embark on whilst beginning to learn C++ in a transition from my former language, C#.

[Bugs] I understand that this program has bugs and I will potentially release an updated version to address these issues, if you find any of these issues please report them so I can inspect them further.

[Installation] The installation is rather straight forward, just ensure that everything is kept within the same folder as the main program requires for the sound files to be in the same directory.
